                Hi, my name is Gabriel Goshorn but you can call me Gabe. I am originally from central Pennsylvania, but these days I live relatively close to Seattle, Washington.
                I have always grown up with a fascination of music and just general problem solving. Going through grade school I would participate in my school's marching band, jazz bands and
                computer science courses. Having these experiences growing up really gave me an idea of what I wanted to do in my career and life. I decided I would go to college and study computer science
                while keeping up with my musical endeavors. I would end up going to Pennsylvania State University while participating in their jazz band and producing my own music on the side. Going out of college
                I wasn't quite sure where in computer science I wanted to go but with my first real job joining Tata Consultancy Services I got some real world experience in Web development. I knew that 
                web development is something I really enjoyed doing in general. Hopefully with this website I have created I can showcase some of the skills I have picked up from doing web development over the past several years.
