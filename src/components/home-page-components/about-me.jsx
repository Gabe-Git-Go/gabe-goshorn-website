                Hello! My name is Gabriel Goshorn, but feel free to call me Gabe. I hail from central Pennsylvania, but now I reside near Seattle, Washington. From a young age, I've been passionate about music and problem-solving. Throughout grade school, I actively participated in my school's marching band and jazz bands, while also diving into computer science courses. These experiences shaped my career aspirations and life goals.
                I pursued a degree in computer science at Pennsylvania State University, where I continued to be involved in the jazz band and produced my own music. Upon graduating, I was unsure which path within computer science to follow. My first job with Tata Consultancy Services provided valuable real-world experience in web development, and I quickly discovered my passion for it.
                This website serves as a showcase of the skills and knowledge I've acquired over the years in web development. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I have enjoyed creating it.
